### Data Preprocessing
* __Load Data__: Import your dataset (e.g., charity_data.csv) into a dataframe.

* __Clean Data:__ Remove irrelevant columns such as EIN and NAME to focus on meaningful data.

* __Analyze Data:__ Identify unique values across columns to understand data distribution and compress categories with rare occurrences into a single "Other" category.
* __Prepare Features and Targets:__ Extract feature (X) and target (y) arrays from the cleaned data.
* __Split Data:__ Divide your dataset into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
* __Normalize Features:__ Apply StandardScaler to your features to standardize your data, enhancing model training efficiency.

### Model Development and Evaluation
* Design Neural Network: Construct a neural network model, defining the appropriate input size, layers, and nodes. Incorporate activation functions suited to your analysis goals.
* Review Model Structure: Ensure your model's architecture aligns with your project objectives.
* Train Model: Compile and train your model on the training dataset, optimizing parameters for best performance.
* Model Evaluation: Assess your model using the testing set to determine its accuracy and loss metrics.
* Save Model: Export your finalized model to an HDF5 file (AlphabetSoupCharity.h5) for deployment or future reference.

### Model Optimization
* Refine Preprocessing: Reevaluate and enhance your data preprocessing steps for improved model input quality.
* Optimize Neural Network: Apply at least three optimization techniques to your model design, aiming to boost performance. Such as: dropping columns, creating more bins, add more hidden layers, user different activation functions, add or reduce number of epochs, etc.
* Export Optimized Model: Save your enhanced model as AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 to document the improvements made.

### Reporting  (Refer to the following link for the [Analysis_Report](https://github.com/mjardinico/deep-learning-challenge/blob/main/Analysis_Report.md))
* Document Analysis: Craft a comprehensive report detailing your project's purpose, methodology, and findings. Use clear titles, sections, and visual aids to enhance readability and comprehension.
* Summarize Findings: Conclude with a summary of your model's performance and insights gained from the analysis.
* Explore Alternatives: Discuss potential alternative modeling techniques that could tackle the same problem, providing rationale for their potential use.
